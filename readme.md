# Rust-Practice 

I am going to dedicate next 2 days on learning basics of rust. Gonna create a lot of handson programs.
Usually I don't make record of these things but I have seen a lot of people do that, so am gonna journal this out this time to know if this helps in someway. 


# Why am I putting this here?
Dunno. Probably a developer ocd to put everything on github.

# Resources I am following:
- [Rust-by-Replacement](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example)
- [Rust basic playlist](https://youtu.be/i1U6VZVlrFw?si=GOd48MN949OyGYfr) (Refer only if you're interested to understand the basics.)
