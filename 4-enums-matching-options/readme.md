# Practice 4

Created using command: 
> cargo new 4-enums-matching-options --name practice-4 
- here I am using the [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) package manger to create a package.
- The name of the directory is 4-enums-matching-options
- The name of the package is practice-4.
- The reason both are kept different is that package name cannot start with a digit.


### What?
Here I am going to test my learnings about:
- enums
- matching
- options
